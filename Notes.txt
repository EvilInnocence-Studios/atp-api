ToDo
====
Fix env setup so the client is cockroachdb
    - need to fix the id columns to be int4s to fix size issues
Make new CockroachDB and retire the old (name and password exposed)
orders
    - make sure BSP and brokered items can't be in orders
    - don't return pending orders to public users
    - purge pending orders periodically
endpoints
    - orders/cart
uac
    - send email on user create
implement row level security decorators
    - Need to allow for admin or non-owner overrides
db init
    - cms data (from PHP site, not Magento, can probably copy manually)

Security Tests
==============
get someone else's order
finalize an order without paying
get products from a pending order
view a pending order
access someone else's account info
purchase BSP items when not subscribed
order transaction failed

Tech Debt
=========
Organize types
Organize endpoints/handlers/utils
Organize env variables
